## 🧠 Author's Note

This calendar was created as a learning project while exploring DOM manipulation and vanilla JavaScript techniques.  
All design and layout decisions were made directly through code – no design tools were used.

If you like it, feel free to fork it or use it as a boilerplate for your own projects.
